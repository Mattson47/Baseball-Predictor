# Baseball-Predictor
CSC 2280 Project

Predicts the number of RBI a player will get in the following season and predicts the amount of money a player should make

The code will analyze the data then ask you the user for a players name 
The code will then take the players name and find it in a file
After it finds the players name in the file it will print out the predicted stats and amount of money they should be paid

How to input the players name
  Capitalize the first letter of the first and last name
  DO NOT use any suffix for a player (ex. Jr, II ...)
